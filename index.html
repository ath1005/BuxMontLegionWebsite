            WELCOME TO THE BUX MONT AMERICAN LEGION LEAGUE'S OFFICIAL WEBSITE !! 
            The Bux Mont American Legion Baseball League consists of eleven franchises 
            in Bucks and Montgomery Counties, playing under the auspices of Pennsylvania 
            American Legion Baseball. The League is a member of Pennsylvania's Region 2, 
            which also encompasses the Berks County, Schuylkill County, Lehigh County, 
            and Northampton County Leagues. Each year, the Bux Mont League's tournament 
            champion goes forward to compete in the eight-team Region 2 tournament, whose 
            winner then competes for the state title. Players usually range in age from 
            16 to 19, with most having completed their junior or senior years in high 
            school or freshman year in college. Players may not reach their 
            twentieth birthday during the current calendar year ... there is no minimum 
            age. The League is governed by the eleven member clubs' representatives, as 
            well as elected officers and a five-person Baseball Commission.
